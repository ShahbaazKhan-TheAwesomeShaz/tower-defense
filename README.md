# tower-defense
## Made using Unity Version - 2020.2.1f1
<br>

### DESCRIPTION
- Normal tower defense game where you have to stop catapults from getting to the end point by placing towers which cost gold..<br>
- you have a certain amount of gold, the gold decreases by a certain value if a catapult reaches the end point,<br>
- the gold increases by a certain value if you kill a catapult.. The difficulty gets ramped up as the level goes on..
- The level just restarts when you die and there is no win condition, survive as long as u can.. 
- The catapults follow a predetermined path.. I will make a separate project for implementing pathfinding
<br> <b> The game is not pretty, just making mechanics cuz I wanna learn some game design principles and stuff</b>


### STUFF LEARNED
- Object Pooling
- Where to use require component (already knew what require component was)
- How to run scripts in edit mode
- Text Mesh Pro has a shader for text to be always visible (can be used in something like waypoint marker as seen in AC BlackFlag and other AAA games)
- List related operations (already knew that a list is a mutable array)
- Nested Prefabs (I don't think I ever wanna use them again that shet too much work)
